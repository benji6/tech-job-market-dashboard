          A lot of this data is OSINT and carries all the typical caveats,
          although it can give insight into trends
        </li>
        <li>
          Latest layoff data is not complete yet so the last period is likely
          understated (except the trueup annual 2025 data which is a projection)
        </li>
        <li>
          Where trueup data is available it is normalized to match the
          layoffs.fyi data within the overlapping period before calculating the
          trend
